This utility can help determine if indicators of compromise (IOCs) exist in the
 log files of a Pulse Secure VPN Appliance for
[CVE-2019-11510](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510).

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has seen many organ
izations breached despite patching their appliance because of Active Directory
credentials (to include Domain Admin) harvested prior to patching. Details are
available in Alert [AA20-107A](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-107a).
This tool may help organizations locate exploitation attempts in their logs and
 assess their risk based on the results. If exploitation attempts are located p
rior to the date of patch, it may be necessary to carefully watch for unauthori
zed connections and perform a full domain password reset.

The IOCs included in this tool are TLP:WHITE. Adding more indicators from open-
source or commercial vendors may improve the effectiveness of this tool.

The tool works by looking for IOCs (strings, Internet Protocol [IP] addresses,
and user agents) associated with Threat Actors exploiting this vulnerability in
 the wild.

> NOTE: check-your-pulse will alert on *ANY* IOCs it finds in the log files. If
>an IOC occurred after patch, it may be a false positive.

## Requirements ##

Python versions 3.6 and above.  Note that Python 2 is **not** supported.

## Installation ##

### PULSE SECURE SETUP ###

> If unauthenticated logging was not enabled prior to patching, you will be rel
>iant on user agent strings and IPs, which are much less reliable indicators.

Detailed instructions regarding pulse secure setup can be found
[here](https://docs.pulsesecure.net/WebHelp/PCS/8.3R3/Content/PCS/PCS_AdminGuide_8.3/Configuring_Events_to_Log.htm).

### CHECK-YOUR-PULSE ###

```console
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/check-your-pulse.git
cd check-your-pulse
```

## Usage ##

```HTML
Download the logs from web console
```

Instructions can be found
[here](https://docs.pulsesecure.net/WebHelp/PCS/8.3R3/Content/PCS/PCS_AdminGuide_8.3/Displaying_System_Logs.htm)
 for version 8.3 of the Pulse Connect Secure.

```console
$ python3 ./app.py --path <path to .events and .access files, defaults to ./>

OUTPUT
```

Detailed usage information can be viewed with:

```console
$ python3 ./app.py -h

usage: app.py [-h] [-r RAW] [-c CSV] [-j JSON] [-p PATH] [-n NUMEVENTS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RAW, --raw RAW     Dumps the output to a human readable file.
  -c CSV, --csv CSV     Writes output to a .csv file. Needs to be provided the
                        name to save as.
  -j JSON, --json JSON  Writes output to a .json file. Needs to be provided
                        the name to save as.
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Path to the folder containing .access and .events.
  -n NUMEVENTS, --numevents NUMEVENTS
                        Number of events to print in the quick summary
                        (default 10)

```
